# Universe: Market

## Role in the Ecosystem
Market is one of the Hempin universes, alongside Fund, Knowledge, Places, and Organizations.  
It is the **commerce layer** of Hempin: a meeting point for **brands, suppliers, and citizens**.  
Market blends **B2B and B2C**:

- **B2B**: onboarding brands, associations, processors, and suppliers.  
- **B2C**: enabling citizens to explore hemp products, learn, and eventually buy.  

Market is the first universe where the Hempin identity becomes tangible through real storefronts, products, and signups.

## Vision
- A **Tmall-like hub for hemp**, where every brand has a customizable storefront.  
- Citizens can discover products with provenance.  
- Over time, Market will integrate advanced features:
  - Entitlements (brand slots, product slots, showroom packages).
  - Richer product discovery (filters, categories, 3D renders).
  - Geo-filtered commerce aligned with hemp/cannabis laws.  
- Market is both **practical infrastructure** (payments, listings) and a **gateway to the Hempin story**.

---

## Roadmap
- **V1 (current)**: Recruit signups. Priority is getting users, brands, and citizens into the system.  
- **V2**: Activate products and brands from Supabase, enable entitlements and checkout.  
- **V3+**: Expand into full B2B/B2C marketplace with advanced discovery and geo-filtered compliance.

## Principles
- **Signups before commerce** → build the community before transactions.  
- **Ship in small green steps** → deploy often, keep momentum.  
- **Universal but local** → global reach, country-specific compliance.  
- **Aligned identity** → Market inherits Hempin’s design system and grows with the other universes.
