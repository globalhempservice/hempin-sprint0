HEMPIN patch: sidebar + entitlements adjust + products harness

What changed
------------
• components/AppShell.tsx:
  - Left sidebar with strong defaults for Account and Admin.
  - "Log out" button calls supabase.auth.signOut() and returns to '/'.

• netlify/functions/entitlements-adjust.ts:
  - Verifies Supabase access JWT from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (no secret needed).
  - Upserts/adjusts entitlements.product_slots for the current user (never below 0).

• pages/account/products/index.tsx:
  - Simple test harness to decrement/increment product_slots through the Netlify function.
  - Shows live slot count and any error text.

Required pre‑reqs
-----------------
• Your project already has lib/supabaseClient.ts and lib/supabaseAdmin.ts.
  NOTE: The Netlify function imports supabaseAdmin via '../../lib/supabaseAdmin' (correct relative path).

Local test
----------
npm run dev
- Visit /account/products
- Click "Use 1 slot" / "Release 1 slot" while signed in.
- Check Supabase -> entitlements table to see product_slots change.

Deploy flow
-----------
- Push a feature branch and PR into `staging` as usual.
- Netlify will build and deploy; test on staging.
